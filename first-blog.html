                            <p>It is always hard to get started and write the first post. There is a lot to share but it is very hard for me to figure out from where to start. I tried many times but failed to write a perfect post. One thing I have learned
                                during all my tries is that you can only do it by start writing. Personally I think so it is way more important to start writing than to write a perfect post. With this in mind, letâ€™s get over this first post.</p>


                            <h2>Introduction</h2>

                            <p>I have completed first year of Computer Science degree at University of Engineering & Technology, Lahore and will probably graduate in 2022. I love frictionless and responsive designs, WordPress, JavaScript, modern technologies
                                and open source to some extent. I love to code something new and innovative. I am fanatic to seasons and every new technology introduced into the market mostly relatable to mobile phones. Friends and my family was , is
                                and will be my world! </p>

                            <h2>Journey to programming</h2>


                            <p>It was almost upto 13 years , my sole dream and goal was to become a civil or mechanical engineer. I worked pretty hard to achieve my dream but their was something planned better for me. It was 24th of september 2018 when my
                                name appeared on the first merit list of computer science displayed by University of Engineering & Technology Lahore.</p>


                            <p> When on 22nd of October I attended the first class , I was fully convinced to change my discipline to an Engineering field. After Attending classes for one week I made a tough decision of staying back on Computer Science.</p>


                            <p>It was 20th November 2018 when I wrote first line of coding and also my first program in C++ to check greater number. At the end of first semester , I realized that man it is the field of computer science that is most suitable
                                to me not the engineering fields. Now after successfully completing my second semester, my interest in this field has reached all time highs. Now I am also wanted to name the things as scientist's name their inventions
                                and this motivates me the most. </p>
